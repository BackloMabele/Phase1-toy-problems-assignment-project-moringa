# Phase1-toy-problems-assignment-project-moringa
this project focuses on the development of three applications, the first assigns 
a grade to learner scores, the second awards offence points to drivers who overspeed, 
the third calculates net income for employees in Kenya.

# Introduction
this project has three files,
* the index1.js file
* the index2.js file
* the index3.js file
the files are part of the toy story projects and relate to different assignments.

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
challenge 1 is adressed in the index1.js file. The file contains an application that
converts student marks to grades.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Challenge 2 is done in the index2.js file. this file uses conditional expressions to achieve
the assignment goals.challenge 2 required that we a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. 
If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above 
the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total 
number of demerit points. 


# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

The task is achieved in the index3.js file. the file highlights the use of multiple tools to 
ensure all possible elements of taxation including deductions and reliefs are taken into consideration.
The solution employs a function that takes in four inputs with one being compulsory and three being
optional. The optional inputs have a default value of 0. the optional inputs are reliefs that are also 
used in the calculations that follow within the function.the task was to develop a program whose major task 
is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate 
the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
